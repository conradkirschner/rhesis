# Test Runs Interface Redesign - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully redesigned the test runs detail page (`/test-runs/[identifier]`) with a modern, dashboard-style interface inspired by the provided mockups while maintaining strict alignment with the existing Rhesis design system.

## What Was Implemented

### ✅ Core Components Created

- Behavior tags for categorization
- Real-time statistics calculation
- Pass rate percentages

#### 7. **TestDetailHistoryTab.tsx** - Historical Performance

- Historical test results table (last 10 runs)
- Current run highlighting
- Execution timestamps
- Pass/fail status per run
- **Summary Statistics Panel**:
  - Total executions
  - Overall pass rate
  - Passed/failed counts
- Color-coded metrics

#### 8. **TestRunMainView.tsx** - Main Container

- **Split-panel layout**: 40/60 ratio (List/Detail)
- Client-side filtering logic
- State management for selection and filters
- Auto-select first test on load
- Responsive layout (stacks on mobile)
- Proper height calculations for scrolling
- Download functionality integration

### ✅ Page Refactoring

#### **page.tsx** - Server Component Updates

- Server-side data fetching for all test results
- Batch fetching of prompts and behaviors
- No pagination needed (client-side filtering)
- Integrated new header component
- Maintained existing charts section
- Preserved comments/tasks integration
- Clean separation of server/client components

## Design System Compliance

### ✅ Material-UI Components Used

- All components use MUI v5+ (no shadcn/ui)
- Consistent with existing codebase
- Cards, Paper, Grids for layout
- Typography with proper variants
- Chips for status indicators
- Buttons with proper variants
- Tables with proper structure
- Tabs with ARIA support
- Accordions for collapsible content
- Popovers for filters

### ✅ Theme Integration

- **Colors**: Using Rhesis color palette
  - Primary: #50B9E0 (Rhesis blue)
  - Success: #2E7D32
  - Error: #C62828
  - Warning: #F57C00
- **Typography**:
  - Sora for major headings (h1-h3)
  - Be Vietnam Pro for body and UI elements
- **Spacing**: Using theme.spacing()
- **Elevation**: Following established elevation system
- **Custom scrollbars**: Consistent styling across components

### ✅ Responsive Design

- Mobile-first approach
- Breakpoints: xs, sm, md
- Stacked layouts on mobile
- Touch-friendly interactions
- Proper padding and spacing

## Technical Decisions

### ✅ Frontend-Only Implementation

- No backend changes required
- Client-side filtering and search
- All data fetched on server-side page load
- No new API endpoints needed
- No database schema changes

### ✅ Performance Optimizations

- useMemo for expensive calculations
- useCallback for function references
- Proper React.memo where beneficial
- Skeleton loading states
- Efficient re-rendering

### ✅ State Management

- React hooks for local state
- No global state management needed
- Clean props drilling
- Proper TypeScript typing

## What Was NOT Implemented (Future Work)

### ⏳ Comparison View

- Skipped as requested (separate work package)
- Would require baseline selection UI
- Side-by-side comparison interface
- Diff indicators for changes

### ⏳ Per-Test Comments/Tasks

- Comments tab in TestDetailPanel (placeholder)
- Tasks tab in TestDetailPanel (placeholder)
- Currently using test-run level comments/tasks only
- Would require backend changes for entity relationships

### ⏳ Advanced Features

- Virtual scrolling for 1000+ tests
- Export individual test results
- Share test links
- Bookmark favorite tests
- Custom metric filtering logic
- Performance trend charts in history tab
